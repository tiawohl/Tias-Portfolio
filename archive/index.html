 <p class="bio">Hi there! My name is Tia Wohl and I am a sophomore at Elon University. I'm currently majoring in Communications Design and plan on also minoring in Computer Science.</p>
 <p class="bio">I am a student staff member at Elon, and have an on campus job at Elon Hillel, the center for Jewish Student Life on campus. My job title is Hospitality Coordinator and Student Manager of Elon Hillel Tours. I have been working for Hillel since my freshman year. This job includes interacting with students, providing tours for perspective students, planning and promiting events.</p>
<p class="bio">I also am a S.M.A.R.T. mentor on campus, representing the CREDE and promoting diversity on campus while mentoring first-year student's of color at Elon University. I work to make sure everyone feels comfortable as they navigate the ups and downs of college life.</p>
<p class="bio">Originally from Staten Island, New York, I grew up with a strong love of communications and illistration. I've always loved art as a kid and was known to be good with people, and after moving to North Carolina in 2007, I quickly became involved with art clubs in school and became an Instructor at my local Taekwondo. I quickly became responsible for creating and managing a pletera of people and ideas from a very young age and continued well into my college years.</p>
<p class="bio">I am excited for you to get to know me more through my background and the work I have accomlished so far! </p>
